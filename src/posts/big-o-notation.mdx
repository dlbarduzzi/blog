Big O notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the efficiency of algorithms
in computer science. It provides a way to measure and compare the performance of
different algorithms based on their growth rates as the input size increases.
Understanding Big O notation is crucial for writing efficient code and optimizing
applications.

## What is Big O Notation?

Big O notation is used to express the worst-case scenario of an algorithm's time
complexity or space complexity. It focuses on the dominant factors that affect the
performance of an algorithm as the input size (‘n’) grows large.

Big O ignores constants and lower-order terms to provide a high-level understanding of
how an algorithm scales.

### Why is Big O Important?

1. **Performance Prediction**: Helps predict how an algorithm will behave as input size
   grows.
2. **Comparison**: Allows developers to compare algorithms and choose the most efficient
   one.
3. **Optimization**: Guides optimization efforts by identifying bottlenecks in code.

## Common Big O Notations

### 1. **O(1): Constant Time**

The runtime does not depend on the size of the input.

Example:

```python
# Accessing an element in an array
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(array[2])  # Always takes the same time
```

### 2. **O(log n): Logarithmic Time**

The runtime grows logarithmically as the input size increases. Common in
divide-and-conquer algorithms like binary search.

Example:

```python
# Binary search
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
def binary_search(array, target):
    low, high = 0, len(array) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

### 3. **O(n): Linear Time**

The runtime grows linearly with the input size. Common in simple loops.

Example:

```python
# Sum of elements in an array
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum = 0
for num in array:
    sum += num
```

### 4. **O(n log n): Linearithmic Time**

Often seen in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort.

Example:

```python
# Merge sort implementation
def merge_sort(array):
    if len(array) <= 1:
        return array
    mid = len(array) // 2
    left = merge_sort(array[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(array[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    while left and right:
        if left[0] < right[0]:
            result.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            result.append(right.pop(0))
    result.extend(left or right)
    return result
```

### 5. **O(n^2): Quadratic Time**

The runtime grows quadratically with the input size. Common in nested loops.

Example:

```python
# Check for duplicates in an array
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in range(len(array)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(array)):
        if array[i] == array[j]:
            print("Duplicate found")
```

### 6. **O(2^n): Exponential Time**

The runtime doubles with each additional input. Common in recursive algorithms that
solve combinatorial problems.

Example:

```python
# Fibonacci sequence using recursion
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

### 7. **O(n!): Factorial Time**

The runtime grows factorially with the input size. Seen in problems that involve
generating all permutations.

Example:

```python
# Generate permutations
def permutations(array):
    if len(array) == 0:
        return [[]]
    result = []
    for i in range(len(array)):
        rest = array[:i] + array[i+1:]
        for perm in permutations(rest):
            result.append([array[i]] + perm)
    return result
```
