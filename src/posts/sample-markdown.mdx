Last summer at Tailwind Connect [I shared a preview of Oxide](https://www.google.com) —
a new high-performance engine for Tailwind CSS that we’ve been working on, designed to
simplify the developer experience and take advantage of how the web platform has evolved
in recent years.

The new engine was originally going to ship as a v3.x release, but even though we’re
committed to backwards compatibility, this feels so clearly like a new generation of the
framework that it deserves to be v4.0.

It’s still early and we’ve got [a lot of work to do](https://www.google.com), but today
we’re [open-sourcing our progress](https://www.google.com) and tagging the first public
[v4.0.0-alpha](https://www.google.com) so you can start experimenting with it and help
us get to a stable release later this year.

I’ll try keep it brief to save some of the excitement for the stable release, but if you
like to play with very early and experimental stuff, there should be plenty of
information here to get you going.
