Last summer at Tailwind Connect [I shared a preview of Oxide](https://www.google.com) —
a new high-performance engine for Tailwind CSS that we’ve been working on, designed to
simplify the developer experience and take advantage of how the web platform has evolved
in recent years.

The new engine was originally going to ship as a v3.x release, but even though we’re
committed to backwards compatibility, this feels so clearly like a new generation of the
framework that it deserves to be v4.0.

It’s still early and we’ve got [a lot of work to do](https://www.google.com), but today
we’re [open-sourcing our progress](https://www.google.com) and tagging the first public
[v4.0.0-alpha](https://www.google.com) so you can start experimenting with it and help
us get to a stable release later this year.

I’ll try keep it brief to save some of the excitement for the stable release, but if you
like to play with very early and experimental stuff, there should be plenty of
information here to get you going.

## A new engine, built for speed

The new engine is a ground-up rewrite, using everything we know about the framework now
to better model the problem space, making things faster with a lot less code.

- **Up to 10x faster** — we can do a full build of the Tailwind CSS website in 105ms
  instead of 960ms, or our Catalyst UI kit in 55ms instead of 341ms.
- **Smaller footprint** — the new engine is over 35% smaller installed, even with the
  heavier native packages we ship like the parts we’ve rewritten in Rust and Lightning
  CSS.
- **Rust where it counts** — we’ve migrated some of the most expensive and
  parallelizable parts of the framework to Rust, while keeping the core of the framework
  in TypeScript for extensibility.
- **One dependency** — the only thing the new engine depends on is Lightning CSS.
- **Custom parser** — we wrote our own CSS parser and designed our own data structures
  tailored to our needs, making parsing over 2x as fast for us as it was with PostCSS. ​

## Unified toolchain

Tailwind CSS v4 isn’t just a plugin anymore — it’s an all-in-one tool for processing
your CSS. We’ve integrated [Lightning CSS](https://www.google.com) directly into the
framework so you don’t have to configure anything about your CSS pipeline.

- **Built-in `@import` handling** — no need to setup and configure a tool like
  `postcss-import`.
- **Built-in vendor prefixing** — you don’t have to add `autoprefixer` to your projects
  anymore.
- **Built-in nesting support** — no plugins needed to flatten nested CSS, it works out
  of the box.
- **Syntax transforms** — modern CSS features like `oklch()` colors and media query
  ranges are transpiled to syntax with better browser support.

We’re still shipping a PostCSS plugin, but we’re also exploring first-party bundler
plugins, and we’re shipping an official Vite plugin with this first alpha release that
you can try out today.
